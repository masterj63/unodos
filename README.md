#unodos
A primitive tool born to make working in terminal a little bit more comfortable.
Sometimes we, the programmers, compile programs from terminal and the compilers (or whatever) print a huge traces of errors.
It sometimes gets hard to find where the last wall of text ends and the newest begins.
It is a good idea ~~to waste~~ to create a noticable space between them.

## How to use
Move binary in `Path` (`~/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, etc.) and run it by calling its name.
Usage example: `javac && unodos` or `javac && unodos 9`.

## How to build it
Install `Rust`, clone the repository, run `cargo build`, obtain binary in `target/debug` directory.
